ðŸŽ¬ Card Effect | Swiper JS Project

ðŸŒŸ Features:

Interactive Swiper Cards: Navigate through the collection with smooth animations and responsive design.
Overlay Effects: Each card features an overlay that displays the show's rating and title for an enhanced visual experience.
Custom Styling: Tailored CSS for a sleek and modern look.
